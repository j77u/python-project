# Python sample Machine Learning
In this project I created a simple machine learning program using data from an excel sheet containing used car prices.
I got the data from this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aleksandrglotov/car-prices-poland and I edited some details.
I added an "age" column to simplify the process, and I also erased everything past 40 rows. I wanted to make this a simple practice project.
In the uploaded files you can see the notes I wrote explaining each step and line of code, as well as the excel sheet itself.
